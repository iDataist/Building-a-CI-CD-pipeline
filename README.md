# Building a CI/CD Pipeline
[![CI](https://github.com/iDataist/Building-a-CI-CD-pipeline/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/iDataist/Building-a-CI-CD-pipeline/actions/workflows/main.yml)
## Overview
Establishing a Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline is critical to enable high-quality customer service experiences in todayâ€™s digital world. In this project, I built a Continuous Delivery pipeline that deploys a Flask Machine Learning application using Azure Pipelines to Azure App Services. First, I used Github Actions to perform an initial install, lint, and test cycle on a machine learning application running in Flask in Azure App Services. Second, I integrated Continuous Delivery using Azure Pipelines to deploy tested application changes automatically to production. Lastly, I tested the prediction capability of the machine learning application deployed into production.
