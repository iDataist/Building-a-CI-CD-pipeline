# Building a CI/CD Pipeline
[![CI](https://github.com/iDataist/Building-a-CI-CD-pipeline/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/iDataist/Building-a-CI-CD-pipeline/actions/workflows/main.yml)
## Overview
Establishing a Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline is critical to enable high-quality customer service experiences in todayâ€™s digital world. In this project, I built a CI/CD pipeline that deploys a Flask Machine Learning application with GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines and Azure App Services. First, I leveraged GubHub actions to implement continuous integration that include install, lint and test steps. The code will always be checked automatically. Second, I used Azure pipeline for continuous delivery. Azure pipeline hooks right into Azure App Services and deployed my Flask application. Lastly, I tested the prediction capability of the machine learning application by giving it a JSON payload.

## Enhancements
Containerize the webapp and deploy it with AKS.
