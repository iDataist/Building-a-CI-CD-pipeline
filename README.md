# Building a CI/CD Pipeline
[![CI](https://github.com/iDataist/Building-a-CI-CD-pipeline/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/iDataist/Building-a-CI-CD-pipeline/actions/workflows/main.yml)

## Overview

Establishing a Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline is critical to enable high-quality customer service experiences in todayâ€™s digital world. In this project, I built a CI/CD pipeline that deploys a Flask Machine Learning application with GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines and Azure App Services. First, I leveraged GitHub actions to implement continuous integration that includes install, lint and test steps. The code will always be checked automatically. Second, I used Azure pipeline for continuous delivery. Azure pipeline hooks right into Azure App Services and deployed my Flask application. Lastly, I tested the prediction capability of the machine learning application by giving it a JSON payload.

## Key Steps

1. Source Control
    * Clone the project from GitHub and open the terminal (with azure-cli installed)

2. Continuous Integration
    * Test and lint the code locally by running the `make all` command from the `Makefile`

    * Test and lint the code with Github Action

3. Continous Delivery
    * Test the app locally by running `python app.py` and generate predictions by running `bash make_prediction.sh`

    * Deploy the machine learning app with Azure Pipelines

4. Platform as a Service
    * View the deployed app on Azure Portal

    * Load-test the web app with locust

    * Generate predictions from the deployed app by running `bash make_predict_azure_app.sh`

    * Review streamed log files from the deployed app
